Code usage instructions
Our project is divided into three parts: machine learning reinforcement learning and dictionary code. Each part has multiple models for training and testing, and specific usage instructions are provided in the technical report. There are two CSV files in the dataset, which are post bar text messages, and some dictionary datasets.
